This is a clone I made of a pre made template from the odin project. It is a simple landing page which focuses mainly on flexbox and aligning content on the page. I specifically followed the instructions by ONLY using flexbox to align this content. After completion of this page I will have gained the experience needed to utilize flexbox in the future. 

note--  This project was not focused on responsiveness or screen size and was created on an large desktop monitor.
